      <p>On my fall 2020 semester, I took a Foundations of Game Design course in SFU’s School of Interactive Arts and Technology. My group and I were tasked to redesign a game and introduce new mechanics to make it more fun and engaging. We had three weeks to complete the project and we used the Unity game engine to create it.</p>
      <p>I lead the team on creating the game, its programming and the game design. My three other teammates, Christine Drummond, Joyce Li, and Kylie Xu, were responsible of the game’s graphics and art. I will be going through my progress of designing the game.</p>

      <h2>Starting Sketches</h2>
      <div class="flex-container image-row">
        <img src="images/Ant/Ant-sketch.jpg" alt="Early design sketches for what the game may include" class="image-sm">
        <img src="images/Ant/Ant-sketch-2.jpg" alt="Early sketch on how the game will play" class="image-sm">
      </div>
      <p>These sketches above show my ideas for the game. At this point, I knew I wanted to make a game that made player think about their surroundings and create a fast route with a strict time limit inside a procedurally generated area. I also wanted to implement a risk/reward mechanic where players can spend limited resources to remove obstacles in their path. The game’s concept was playing an ant trying to escape an ant lion’s pit. The player could find other ants and they could sacrifice them to remove one obstacle in their path such as a rock or slow the ant lion by letting one them get eaten. After pitching this idea to our professor and teacher assistant, they didn’t like its morbidity, so we needed to come up with a different idea.</p>

      <h2>Working through Iterations</h2>
      <div class="image-row">
        <img src="images/Ant/Ant-early-game.JPG" alt="Early iteration of Ant Blast" class="image-sm">
        <img src="images/Ant/Ant-late-game.JPG" alt="Later iteration of Ant Blast" class="image-sm">
      </div>
      <p>My new concept was having the ability to push rocks around similar to pushing blocks in 2D Legend of Zelda games. This would give the player more options on their pathing as they can alter the world around them. I also thought about giving the player a limited number of bombs which they can use to blow up rocks or temporarily stop the ant lion. This was inspired by the ant sacrificing mechanic of using resources to solve problems. We were quite happy with this idea and so I started creating the game on Unity. The image on the left is an early prototype of the game, using temporary graphics and was a testing ground for pushing rocks, procedural generation and sand being thrown at the player. We had playtesters try out this prototype and they had issues with the ant lion’s speed, found bugs while the right is from a later prototype where we added the graphics, and tweaked aspects that our playtesters had issues with.</p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>This project went fairly well. The course’s teaching team liked our game and complimented it on its interesting game design. Our playtesters liked the game, however the playtesters who didn’t play much video games had thought it was very difficult. I wish we could have had more time to improve the UI more and to add more of a sense of progression in the game. Overall, this game gave me a chance to create engaging and interesting game mechanics and I think I succeeded on that task. </p>
